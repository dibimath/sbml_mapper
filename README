# TREMPPI SBML-mapper

### Description

SBML is a standard file format for easy interchange of computer models of biological processes and systems.
A specification of the format can be found on http://sbml.org .

For qualitative models of gene regulatory networks, where gene activity is modeled as a discrete "activity state"
of network components/nodes or "qualitative species", a specialized SBML package (qualitative SBML) is available.
The package specifications can be found at http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML_Level_3/Packages/qual .

This tool allows import and export of qualitative SBML model descriptions to and from the
TREMPPI model database format.

### Functionality

The SBML-mapper creates a TREMPPI database model

### Prerequisites

Package **libsbml**. (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml)

Provides functions and an interface for parsing and creating SBML documents in Python.

### Use

All functionality is included in the two python source files *sbml2db.py* and *db2sbml.py*.

The folder *data* includes example TREMPPI databases and qualSBML model files (see *Examples*).
It is not required for tool functionality.

To run the examples in a Python IDE, uncomment the appropriate lines on the bottom of both source files (see *Examples*).

The tool is meant for implementation into TREMPPI and does not support any direct command line functionality.
To use it, simply pass the appropriate parameters to the two interface functions
*writeSBMLToDBModel()* and *writeDBModelToSBML()*:

##### Import SBML Model File

    Function writeSBMLToDBModel(database_path, sbml_input_path, use_species_name_attribute=False, print_warnings=True)

    Reads a qualSBML document and converts the network model to a TREMPPI database model description.

    Input parameters:
        1) database_path: (String) File path for the TREMPPI model database;
        existing files/databases at this location will be deleted.
        2) sbml_input_path: (String) File path to the qualSBML input file.
        3) use_species_name_attribute: (Logical) If True, the function will try to use the "name" attribute
        of a qualSBML Qualitative Species, instead of the "Id" attribute.
        Will throw an appropriate exception if not successful. (Default setting: False)
        4) print_warnings: (Logical) If True, warnings for non-critical problems will be printed to console.
        (Default setting: True)

    Output:
        If the qualSBML file is successfully parsed, a model database is created at database_path.

##### Export SBML Model File

    Function writeDBModelToSBML(database_path, sbml_output_path, modelRow=1)

    Exports a TREMPPI model to a qualSBML file.

    Input parameters:
        1) database_path (String): File path of the TREMPPI model database.
        2) sbml_output_path (String): File path for the qualSBML output file.
        3) modelRow (Integer): The row of database table "Parametrizations" to be exported as qualSBML.
        Row indexing starts at 1 rather than 0. (Default setting: 1)

    Output:
        If no error occurs, a qualSBML file of the specified model is created at sbml_output_path.
